<!-- Goal: Your assignment is to create a web page to get an order for a new café in Medford called “Joe’s
Hotdog Stand”. Joe’s only sells three items: hotdogs ($4.65 each), French Fries ($3.75 each), and
Drinks ($1.89 each). Joe is swamped due to his delectable hotdogs and is hoping online orders
will help to manage the flow better. -->
